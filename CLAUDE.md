## Development Commands

### Basic Commands
- `npm start` - Run the MCP server with current directory as working directory
- `npm run dev` - Run the MCP server with `./test` directory as working directory
- `node src/direct-executor-server.js [working-directory]` - Run server with specific working directory

### Testing
- `node test-search-final.js` - Run the main code search functionality test
- No automated test suite - manual testing with actual MCP clients

### Installation as MCP Tool
- **Claude Code**: `claude mcp add glootie "npx" "-y" "mcp-glootie" "path/to/your/project"`
- **Direct execution**: `npx mcp-glootie [working-directory]`

   - Optional `workingDirectory` parameter for execution context

3. **`searchcode`** - Semantic code search with AI embeddings
   - Natural language query processing
   - Structural code understanding (functions, classes, methods)
   - Optional `workingDirectory` parameter to specify search scope

4. **`astgrep_search`** - Pattern-based structural code search
   - AST-aware pattern matching with meta-variables
   - Multi-language support via tree-sitter
   - Structural understanding beyond text matching

5. **`astgrep_replace`** - Code transformation and refactoring

   - Structural pattern detection for code quality
   - Custom rule enforcement and validation

7. **`astgrep_analyze`** - AST structure analysis and debugging
   - Pattern debugging and AST exploration
   - Meta-variable extraction and analysis
   - Code structure understanding and validation

### Working Directory Behavior

All MCP tools accept an optional `workingDirectory` parameter:
- When provided: Uses the specified directory for operation context
- When omitted: Falls back to the server's startup working directory
- Path validation ensures directories exist and are accessible

## Code Architecture Principles

### File Organization
- Maximum 110 lines per file to maintain readability
- Clean separation between execution and search functionality
- Modular design with clear responsibilities

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error propagation with contextual information
- Debug mode support for detailed error logging
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Configuration Philosophy
- Convention over configuration: Self-configuring with sensible defaults
- Configuration over code: Parameterized behavior, no hardcoded values
- Environment-aware: Respects `.gitignore` patterns and project structure

## Dependencies

### Essential Dependencies
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (^1.11.0) - Official MCP SDK for server implementation
- `@xenova/transformers` (^2.17.2) - ML transformers for semantic search embeddings
- `@ast-grep/napi` (^0.28.0) - AST-grep bindings for structural code analysis

### Development Environment
- **Node.js**: >=16.0.0 required
- **Package type**: ESM modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **Binary**: Executable via `npx mcp-repl`

## Key Implementation Details

### Code Execution
- Creates temporary files for ESM module execution
- Uses stdin piping for CommonJS execution
- Proper cleanup of temporary resources
- Working directory context preservation

### Semantic Search
- Self-configuring code index with automatic file discovery
- Transformer model loading with graceful fallback
- Hybrid scoring combining semantic similarity and text matching
- Real-time indexing with file system monitoring capability

### AST-based Analysis
- Structural pattern matching using abstract syntax trees
- Multi-language support via tree-sitter parsers
- Meta-variable extraction and code transformation
- Rule-based validation and custom linting capabilities

### Security Considerations
- Working directory validation to prevent path traversal
- Controlled child process execution with timeouts
- Proper resource cleanup and error boundaries

## Usage Patterns

### Hypothesis-Driven Debugging
The MCP tools are designed for iterative code testing and exploration:
1. Execute code hypotheses with `executenodejs`/`executedeno`
2. Search for similar patterns with `searchcode` or `astgrep_search`
3. Transform and refactor code with `astgrep_replace`
4. Validate code quality with `astgrep_lint`
5. Analyze code structure with `astgrep_analyze`
6. Iterate and refine based on results

### Multi-Project Support
Working directory parameters enable operation across multiple projects:
- Specify different working directories per operation
- Search across different codebases with semantic or structural patterns
- Execute code in various project contexts
- Apply consistent transformations across multiple projects
- Validate code quality with custom rules across codebases

## Important Notes

- All tool parameters are validated with clear error messages
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing MCP clients  
- No hardcoded paths or configuration - fully parameterized
- Comprehensive AST-based code analysis alongside semantic search
- Multi-language support for structural code operations
- Designed for both standalone use and integration with AI coding assistants
