- **executedeno**: **TYPESCRIPT EXECUTION ENGINE** - Execute TypeScript/JavaScript with Deno runtime. **ALWAYS USE FOR TYPE-SAFE OPERATIONS** and when TypeScript validation is needed.
- **executebash**: **BASH COMMAND EXECUTION ENGINE** - Execute bash commands with mandatory working directory context and batching support. **USE FOR SYSTEM OPERATIONS** that require shell access.
- **batch_execute**: 

### Search Tools (4)  
- **searchcode**: **INTELLIGENT CODE DISCOVERY** - AI-powered semantic search with structural understanding. **ALWAYS USE THIS FIRST** for code exploration before reading files or using other search tools.
- **astgrep_search**: **STRUCTURAL CODE ANALYSIS** - AST-based pattern matching for precise code discovery. **ALWAYS USE FOR STRUCTURAL PATTERN MATCHING** when you need exact syntactic matches.
- **astgrep_enhanced_search**: **ENHANCED AST-GREP SEARCH** - Advanced pattern search with structured JSON output, metadata, and performance insights. **ALWAYS USE FOR DETAILED ANALYSIS** with comprehensive result formatting.
- **astgrep_constraint_search**: **CONSTRAINT-BASED AST SEARCH** - Advanced search with validation constraints, performance thresholds, and meta-variable validation. **ALWAYS USE FOR PRECISE FILTERING** of search results.

### AST-grep Tools (9)
- **astgrep_replace**: **INTELLIGENT CODE TRANSFORMATION** - AST-based code rewriting with meta-variable substitution. **ALWAYS USE FOR SAFE, STRUCTURAL REFACTORING** after identifying patterns with search tools.
- **astgrep_lint**: **COMPREHENSIVE CODE QUALITY ENFORCEMENT** - YAML-based rule engine for structural code validation. **ALWAYS USE FOR SYSTEMATIC QUALITY ASSURANCE** across entire codebases.
- **astgrep_analyze**: **DEEP STRUCTURAL CODE INVESTIGATION** - AST exploration and pattern debugging tool. **ALWAYS USE FOR COMPLEX PATTERN ANALYSIS** and understanding intricate code structures.
- **astgrep_multi_pattern**: **MULTI-PATTERN AST SEARCH** - Search for multiple patterns with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). **ALWAYS USE FOR COMPLEX QUERIES** that require sophisticated pattern combinations.
- **astgrep_project_init**: **PROJECT CONFIGURATION SETUP** - Initialize ast-grep configuration and rules for a project. **ALWAYS USE TO BOOTSTRAP** ast-grep integration in new or existing projects.
- **astgrep_project_scan**: **PROJECT-WIDE CODE SCANNING** - Comprehensive analysis of entire projects using ast-grep rules. **ALWAYS USE FOR CODEBASE HEALTH ASSESSMENT** and quality metrics.
- **astgrep_test**: **RULE TESTING AND VALIDATION** - Test ast-grep rules against code examples to ensure correctness. **ALWAYS USE FOR RULE DEVELOPMENT** and quality assurance.
- **astgrep_validate_rules**: **RULE VALIDATION ENGINE** - Comprehensive validation of ast-grep rules for syntax, logic, and performance. **ALWAYS USE FOR RULE QUALITY ASSURANCE**.
- **astgrep_debug_rule**: **RULE DEBUGGING TOOLKIT** - Debug and analyze specific ast-grep rules with detailed output. **ALWAYS USE FOR TROUBLESHOOTING** rule behavior and pattern matching.\n\n**MANDATORY WORKING DIRECTORY:**\nâ€¢ workingDirectory parameter is **REQUIRED** - specify the exact project directory for rule debugging

### Batch Tools (0)


### Utility Tools (2)
- **sequentialthinking**: **SEQUENTIAL THINKING ENGINE** - Always use this tool, no exceptions. Process and store sequential thoughts with mandatory local data persistence.
- **retrieve_overflow**: **OVERFLOW CONTENT RETRIEVAL** - Retrieve truncated content from overflow files when tool responses exceed 25k tokens. **ALWAYS SPECIFY WORKING DIRECTORY** for overflow access.

### Other Tools (0)


## Description Length Analysis
- **Longest**: 7544 chars
- **Shortest**: 1163 chars  
- **Average**: 4287 chars
- **Total Token Estimate**: ~20361 tokens

## Recommendations

### High Priority Issues
1. **Token Efficiency**: Descriptions are very verbose, totaling ~20361 tokens
2. **Tool Redundancy**: Multiple tools with overlapping functionality
3. **Missing Core Features**: No file system navigation, no git integration, no project analysis

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Compress descriptions** to essential information only
2. **Remove redundant tools** and consolidate functionality
3. **Add missing groundbreaking features** for code editing workflows
4. **Improve output formats** with line numbers and structured data

### Missing Tools Needed
- **Project analyzer** - understand codebase structure
- **Git integration** - branch management, commit analysis  
- **File navigation** - tree structure, file relationships
- **Dependency analysis** - package.json, imports/exports
- **Performance profiler** - built-in benchmarking
- **Code quality metrics** - complexity, coverage analysis
