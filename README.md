  - **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Execute with Node.js or Deno
  - **Go** - Execute with `go run` (when Go CLI available)
  - **Rust** - Compile and execute with `rustc` (when Rust CLI available)
  - **Python** - Execute with `python3` (when Python CLI available)
  - **C** - Compile and execute with `gcc` (when GCC available)
  - **C++** - Compile and execute with `g++` (when G++ available)
  - **Bash** - Run bash commands securely
- **retrieve_overflow** - Handle large content from previous operations

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g mcp-glootie
```

### Language Runtime Requirements

For full multi-language support, install the following CLI tools:

- **Go**: `go` - Install from https://golang.org/
- **Rust**: `rustc` and `cargo` - Install from https://rustup.rs/
- **Python**: `python3` - Usually pre-installed on Linux/macOS
- **C**: `gcc` - Install build-essential or Xcode Command Line Tools
- **C++**: `g++` - Included with gcc installation
- **Node.js**: `node` - Install from https://nodejs.org/
- **Deno**: `deno` - Install from https://deno.land/

**Note**: The tools automatically detect which language runtimes are available and enable features accordingly.

## Tools

### searchcode
Search for code patterns across your multi-language codebase with semantic understanding.

### astgrep_search
Find structural code patterns using AST matching across JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python, C, and C++.

### astgrep_replace
Safely transform code patterns with AST-based replacement for all supported languages.

### execute
Execute code in multiple languages with automatic runtime detection and CLI tool integration.

### batch_execute
Coordinate multiple tools in single operations for efficiency across different languages.

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive performance testing suite (`test-runner.cjs`) that:

- **Parallel Testing**: Runs baseline vs MCP-optimized tests simultaneously
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Incremental file writing prevents stuck processes
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Tracks tool usage, performance metrics, and MCP server status
- **Automatic Reporting**: Generates detailed analysis reports and suggestions

### Test Runner Features

- **Incremental File Writing**: Step data written every 10 operations to prevent hanging
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time updates during test execution
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of failed tests with detailed error reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures speed improvements and tool effectiveness

Run tests with:
```bash
node test-runner.cjs
```

## Architecture

- Clean, simple implementation following KISS principles
- Minimal dependencies and straightforward code structure
- Future-proof design with clear separation of concerns
- Focus on essential functionality without unnecessary complexity
- Robust testing infrastructure with incremental progress tracking
