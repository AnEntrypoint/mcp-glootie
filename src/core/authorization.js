TASK COMPLEXITY: BASIC - Use simple, efficient approaches

PREFERRED TOOLS: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep
- Focus on direct file operations and simple commands
- Avoid complex analysis tools unless absolutely necessary
- Use single-step solutions where possible

DISCOURAGED FOR BASIC TASKS:
- batch_execute (adds overhead for simple operations)
- TodoWrite (unnecessary planning for straightforward tasks)
- Complex search/analysis tools (use only if required)

PRINCIPLE: Keep it simple - the most direct path is usually best for basic tasks.`
