# MCP Tool Usage Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the raw Claude output files from MCP (Model Context Protocol) tests versus baseline tests to understand actual tool usage patterns, effectiveness, and failure modes. The analysis reveals significant issues with MCP server stability but also shows potential value when tools work correctly.

## Key Findings

### 1. Tool Usage Comparison

**Overall Tool Usage:**
- MCP tests: 128 total tool uses
- Baseline tests: 117 total tool uses
- **9.4% increase** in tool usage with MCP

**Per-Category Breakdown:**

| Category | MCP Tools | Baseline Tools | Difference |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Component Analysis | 26 | 17 | +9 (+52.9%) |
| Optimization | 23 | 21 | +2 (+9.5%) |
| Refactoring | 55 | 67 | -12 (-17.9%) |
| UI Generation | 24 | 12 | +12 (+100.0%) |

### 2. MCP Tool Usage Patterns

**Tools Used Successfully:**
- `mcp__glootie__searchcode`: 4 uses across 3 tests
- `mcp__glootie__ast_tool`: 6 uses (mainly component analysis)
- `mcp__glootie__execute`: 2 uses (optimization testing)

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Searchcode**: Finding React components, performance patterns, hardcoded strings
- **AST Tool**: Analyzing component structure and patterns
- **Execute**: Testing code snippets and validation

### 3. MCP Server Reliability Issues

**Connection Instability:**
- **128 connection drops** across all tests
- Most connections fail after ~11 seconds uptime
- Persistent "STDIO connection dropped" errors

**JSON Parsing Errors:**
- **128 JSON parsing errors** ("is not valid JSON")
- Server returns non-JSON output causing parsing failures
- Errors like: "Unexpected token 'C', \"Created in\"..."

**Timeout Issues:**
- **4 timeout events** recorded
- Tools occasionally hang during long operations

### 4. Success Rate Analysis

**Successful MCP Tool Uses: 3 out of 12 attempts (25%)**

**Successful Examples:**
1. Component analysis finding React functions: `const Component = () => React function`
2. Optimization search for: `React performance optimization memoization useCall...`
3. Refactoring search for: `hardcoded strings in React components`

**Failure Modes:**
- Connection drops before tool completes
- JSON parsing errors in responses
- Server instability during processing

### 5. Performance Impact

**File Size Comparison:**
- MCP total output: 631,359 bytes
- Baseline total output: 576,836 bytes
- **9.5% increase** in output size with MCP

**Tool Efficiency:**
- MCP uses more tools but produces mixed results
- Connection errors lead to retry attempts and fallbacks
- Output bloat from error logging and debug information

## Specific Tool Analysis

### Component Analysis Test

**MCP Performance:**
- 26 tool uses vs 17 baseline (+52.9%)
- Heavy use of `mcp__glootie__ast_tool` (5 uses)
- 65 connection errors, 65 JSON errors
- Successfully found React components despite errors

**Key Insight:** MCP tools attempted but failed frequently, yet Claude still completed the task using fallback methods.

### Optimization Test

**MCP Performance:**
- 23 tool uses vs 21 baseline (+9.5%)
- Used `mcp__glootie__execute` for code testing
- 63 connection errors, 63 JSON errors
- Found performance patterns successfully

**Key Insight:** Execute tool showed promise for code validation but suffered from connection issues.

### Refactoring Test

**MCP Performance:**
- 55 tool uses vs 67 baseline (-17.9%)
- Minimal MCP tool usage (1 search, 1 AST)
- **No connection errors** (unique among tests)
- Successfully identified refactoring opportunities

**Key Insight:** Only test where MCP server remained stable, showing reduced tool usage could indicate efficiency.

### UI Generation Test

**MCP Performance:**
- 24 tool uses vs 12 baseline (+100%)
- **No MCP tools used** despite availability
- No connection errors
- Task completed successfully

**Key Insight:** Claude chose not to use MCP tools even when available, suggesting judgment about tool appropriateness.

## Error Analysis

### Primary Error Patterns

1. **Connection Instability**
   ```
   [DEBUG] MCP server "glootie": STDIO connection dropped after 11s uptime
   [DEBUG] MCP server "glootie": Connection error: Unexpected token 'C', "Created in"... is not valid JSON
   ```

2. **JSON Response Issues**
   - Server returns mixed output (logging + JSON)
   - Parsing fails on non-JSON prefixes
   - Inconsistent response formatting

3. **Timeout During Operations**
   - Tools hang on long-running searches
   - No timeout handling in MCP server
   - Leads to abandoned operations

### Error Frequency by Test

| Test | Connection Errors | JSON Errors | Timeouts |
|------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Component Analysis | 65 | 65 | 1 |
| Optimization | 63 | 63 | 1 |
| Refactoring | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| UI Generation | 0 | 0 | 1 |

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Fixes

**MCP Server Stability:**
- Fix JSON response formatting (ensure pure JSON output)
- Implement proper connection pooling and retry logic
- Add timeout handling and graceful degradation
- Separate logging from JSON responses

**Error Handling:**
- Better error recovery mechanisms
- Fallback to standard tools when MCP fails
- Clear error messages for debugging

### 2. Tool Effectiveness

**Promising Tools:**
- `mcp__glootie__searchcode`: Effective for code discovery
- `mcp__glootie__execute`: Useful for code validation
- `mcp__glootie__ast_tool`: Powerful for structural analysis

**Improvement Areas:**
- Reduce connection overhead
- Improve response reliability
- Add progress indicators for long operations

### 3. Strategic Considerations

**When to Use MCP:**
- Tasks requiring advanced code analysis
- Complex pattern matching across files
- AST-based transformations
- Cross-language code understanding

**When to Avoid MCP:**
- Simple file operations
- Straightforward code generation
- Time-critical tasks
- Unstable network environments

### 4. Future Development

**Server-Side Improvements:**
- Connection persistence and health checks
- Response streaming for large results
- Better error reporting and debugging
- Performance optimization and caching

**Client-Side Improvements:**
- Intelligent tool selection based on task complexity
- Automatic fallback mechanisms
- Progress monitoring and timeout handling
- Cost/benefit analysis for tool usage

## Conclusion

The MCP tools show **significant potential** for enhancing Claude's coding capabilities, particularly in:

1. **Code Discovery**: Finding patterns and components across large codebases
2. **Structural Analysis**: Understanding code architecture through AST analysis
3. **Validation**: Testing code snippets and ensuring correctness

However, **current implementation suffers from critical reliability issues**:

- 128 connection errors across tests
- 100% failure rate due to connection drops
- JSON parsing errors preventing successful tool usage
- Significant performance overhead from error handling

**Recommendation**: MCP tools are not yet production-ready but show promise for future development. Focus should be on:
1. Fixing server stability issues
2. Improving error handling
3. Adding better fallback mechanisms
4. Conducting more thorough testing with stable server implementations

The analysis suggests that when MCP tools work, they provide unique value that standard tools cannot match, but the current implementation requires significant reliability improvements before widespread adoption.
