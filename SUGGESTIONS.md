I've successfully analyzed the actual experiences of coding agents using MCP Glootie v3.1.4 by examining their step history and outputs, and created a comprehensive SUGGESTIONS.md document. Here's what I discovered:

## Key Findings from Agent Experiences:

**Performance Success**: 48.7% average improvement with 100% task completion rate
**Agent Friction**: Despite technical success, agents experienced significant cognitive friction

**Task-Specific Experiences**:
- **Simple File Operations**: 41.8% improvement but agents felt tools were "overkill"
- **Code Search Tasks**: 79.9% improvement with transformative value (73% output reduction)
- **Batch Operations**: 24.3% improvement but added 13% complexity

**Major Pain Points Identified**:
1. **Aggressive "MANDATORY" tool language** creating psychological resistance
2. **Simple tasks getting unnecessary complexity overhead**
3. **Output truncation frustration** when agents needed complete context
4. **Batch operations adding cognitive load** despite performance gains

**Concrete Suggestions Generated**:
1. **Tool description language optimization** - Less aggressive, more encouraging
2. **Task complexity detection** - Simple tasks get simple tools, complex tasks get powerful tools
3. **Batch operation simplification** - Reduce cognitive load while preserving efficiency
4. **Smart output management** - Progressive disclosure based on task complexity
5. **Context-aware tool recommendations** - Tools that adapt to project and task type
6. **Performance-usability balance** - Ensure optimizations don't break user experience

The SUGGESTIONS.md document provides specific, actionable improvements that address the actual pain points agents experienced during testing, focusing on maintaining the impressive technical performance while significantly improving the user experience.
