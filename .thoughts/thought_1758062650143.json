    "From analyzing the actual step data, I found that agents didn't use MCP tools at all - no mcp__glootie___* tools were found in any of the output files",
    "The performance data shows interesting patterns: Baseline had 60.5% success rate (224 steps) vs MCP with 54.7% success rate (252 steps)",
    "Key finding: MCP agents used more steps but had lower success rates, suggesting they encountered more friction",
    "Tool usage patterns show MCP agents used MultiEdit (4 times) vs baseline never used it, but baseline had higher overall success",
    "Error patterns are significant: MCP refactoring had 26 errors vs baseline 9 errors - that's a major pain point",
    "The agents relied on conventional tools even when MCP tools were available, indicating a trust/usability issue",
    "Success varied by task type: UI generation worked well with both approaches, but refactoring was particularly problematic with MCP",
    "The data shows agents adapted their approach based on what worked, not what was theoretically available"
