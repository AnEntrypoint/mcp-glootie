    "I've been analyzing the actual step-by-step experiences of coding agents during the MCP Glootie v3.1.4 benchmarking tests. From examining the step files, I can see the real story of what happened:",
    "1. The baseline tests show agents using conventional tools (TodoWrite, Glob, Read, Write, Bash) with straightforward patterns and clear success rates.",
    "2. The MCP tests show a different experience - agents were able to accomplish the same tasks but with different tool usage patterns.",
    "3. Looking at the actual step data, I can see that agents in MCP tests still primarily used conventional tools rather than the specialized MCP tools.",
    "4. The performance data shows that baseline tests completed successfully with good timing (85 seconds for component analysis), and MCP tests also completed but with different approaches.",
    "5. The key finding is that the MCP tools weren't actually being used extensively - the agents still relied on conventional tools for most operations.",
    "6. From the step files, I can see agents following systematic approaches: creating todos, exploring codebases, analyzing components, implementing improvements, and validating results.",
    "7. The experience seems to show that agents can accomplish complex development tasks with both conventional and MCP tools, but the MCP tools may not have provided significant advantages for these particular test scenarios.",
    "8. The real agent experience was one of systematic problem-solving regardless of tool availability - they adapted their approach based on the tools available."
