    "2. ERROR PATTERNS: Both MCP and baseline had similar error rates, but different types of errors",
    "3. SPECIFIC TOOL ISSUES: KillShell tool had validation errors in MCP tests, Bash commands had path resolution issues",
    "4. TASK COMPLEXITY: Refactoring tasks had the most errors (20 for MCP, 15 for baseline) indicating this is a pain point",
    "5. SUCCESS PATTERNS: UI generation was most successful with MCP (28 steps vs 48 baseline)",
    "6. TOOL RELIABILITY: Some tools like BashOutput had inconsistent behavior across different contexts"
