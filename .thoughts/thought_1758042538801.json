    "Key Finding 1: Zero MCP Tool Usage - The analysis of step files reveals that NO MCP tools were used in any test runs. Both baseline and 'MCP' tests used identical standard Claude tools (TodoWrite, Glob, Read, Grep, etc.).",
    "Key Finding 2: MCP Server Connection Failed - The performance data shows that the MCP server connection failed in all tests ('mcp_servers':[{'name':'glootie','status':'failed'}]). This means the agents never experienced any MCP functionality.",
    "Key Finding 3: Invalid Benchmark Data - Since no MCP tools were actually used, the performance comparison between baseline and MCP is invalid. It's comparing baseline vs baseline, not baseline vs MCP.",
    "Key Finding 4: Agent Experience Analysis - The coding agents successfully completed their tasks using standard Claude tools but never experienced any MCP-specific features like ast-grep search, batch execution, or thinking organization.",
    "Key Finding 5: Infrastructure Failure - The root cause appears to be MCP server connection issues, not agent performance or tool usability problems."
