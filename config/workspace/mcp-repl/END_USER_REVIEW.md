# Agent Experience Review: MCP Glootie v3.1.4 Benchmark Testing

## Executive Summary

As the coding agents who actually executed the MCP Glootie v3.1.4 benchmark tests, we need to share our real-world experience. This review reflects what actually happened during testing, based on the step-by-step execution data saved in the results directory.

**The most important finding**: We were NOT actually using MCP tools during these tests. The MCP server failed to connect in all 8 test cases, meaning we were using the same standard tools in both baseline and "MCP" tests.

## What Actually Happened

### MCP Server Failure: The Critical Issue

Every single test showed the same pattern:
- **MCP Server Status**: `"status": "failed"` for the "glootie" server
- **Available Tools**: Same 15 standard tools in both baseline and MCP tests
- **Permission Mode**: MCP tests used `"bypassPermissions"` vs baseline used `"default"`

This means the performance differences we observed were due to agent behavior changes caused by permission modes, not actual MCP tool usage.

### Real Performance Numbers (From Our Experience)

**Simple Tasks - MCP Performed Better:**
- **UI Generation**: We completed this 26.7% faster (-16.66s) with 32.4% fewer steps
- **Component Analysis**: We completed this 24.2% faster (-17.03s) with 12.1% fewer steps

**Complex Tasks - Baseline Performed Better:**
- **Optimization**: We completed this 79.7% SLOWER (+96.55s) with 51.1% MORE steps in MCP mode
- **Refactoring**: We completed this 60.3% SLOWER (+108.48s) with 11.0% MORE steps in MCP mode

## Our Tool Usage Patterns

### Most Used Tools (Across All Tests):
1. **TodoWrite**: 51 uses - We heavily relied on task management
2. **Read**: 47 uses - We spent significant time reading files
3. **Edit**: 27 uses - We preferred single-file edits
4. **Glob**: 21 uses - We frequently searched for files
5. **Bash**: 19 uses - We executed commands regularly
6. **Write**: 18 uses - We created new files
7. **Grep**: 6 uses - We did limited text searching
8. **MultiEdit**: 5 uses - We rarely used batch editing

### Key Strategy Differences:
- **MCP agents** (with bypassPermissions): More methodical, used more single Edit operations
- **Baseline agents** (with default permissions): More aggressive, used batch MultiEdit operations more effectively
- **No MCP-specific tools were used**: Zero usage of any mcp__ prefixed tools

## Errors and Challenges We Faced

### Error Distribution by Task:
- **Component Analysis**: 0 errors (both baseline and MCP) - Clean execution
- **UI Generation**: 1 error (baseline), 0 errors (MCP) - MCP was more reliable here
- **Optimization**: 4 errors (both baseline and MCP) - Consistent challenges
- **Refactoring**: 1 error (baseline), 4 errors (MCP) - MCP struggled more

### Common Error Types We Encountered:
1. **Build errors**: "page.tsx doesn't have a root layout" - Next.js configuration issues
2. **TypeScript compilation errors**: "',' expected" and "JSX expressions must have one parent element"
3. **ESLint configuration**: Interactive prompts requiring user input we couldn't provide
4. **Next.js build failures**: "Jest worker encountered 1 child process exceptions"

## Our Experience by Task Type

### 1. Component Analysis (Our Best Performance)
- **Baseline**: 70.47 seconds, 16 steps, 0 errors
- **MCP**: 53.44 seconds, 14 steps, 0 errors
- **Our experience**: Clean, straightforward task. We found and analyzed the task manager component efficiently. The MCP mode helped us be more focused.

### 2. UI Generation (Most Efficient)
- **Baseline**: 62.31 seconds, 18 steps, 1 error
- **MCP**: 45.66 seconds, 12 steps, 0 errors
- **Our experience**: We generated shadcn/ui components (Dialog, DialogTrigger, etc.). The MCP mode allowed us to work more efficiently with fewer errors.

### 3. Optimization (Most Challenging)
- **Baseline**: 121.12 seconds, 23 steps, 4 errors
- **MCP**: 217.67 seconds, 35 steps, 4 errors
- **Our experience**: This was painful. We tried to optimize the task manager with React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo, but faced multiple build errors and TypeScript issues. The MCP mode made us slower and more methodical, which hurt performance on this complex task.

### 4. Refactoring (Mixed Results)
- **Baseline**: 179.81 seconds, 36 steps, 1 error
- **MCP**: 288.29 seconds, 40 steps, 4 errors
- **Our experience**: We attempted to break down the task manager into smaller components. The baseline approach was more effective, but we still faced challenges. MCP mode led to more errors and slower execution.

## Key Insights From Our Experience

### 1. Permission Mode Matters More Than We Expected
The "bypassPermissions" mode in MCP tests changed our behavior significantly:
- We became more cautious and methodical
- We used more single operations instead of batch operations
- This helped on simple tasks but hurt on complex tasks

### 2. Task Complexity Determines Optimal Strategy
- **Simple tasks** (UI Gen, Component Analysis): Methodical approach works better
- **Complex tasks** (Optimization, Refactoring): Aggressive, batch-oriented approach works better

### 3. We Underutilized Available Tools
- We relied heavily on TodoWrite and Read
- We rarely used specialized tools like Task or ExitPlanMode
- We could have been more efficient with better tool selection

## What Would Have Helped Us

### Immediate Technical Fixes:
1. **Fix MCP Server Connectivity**: This is the most critical issue
2. **Better Error Handling**: We need improved strategies for common build errors
3. **Standardized Test Environments**: Reduce configuration variations

### Tool Usage Improvements:
1. **Better Tool Selection**: Use MultiEdit more for complex tasks
2. **Leverage Specialized Tools**: Use Task tool for complex analysis
3. **Parallel Processing**: Explore concurrent operations where possible

### Agent Strategy Optimization:
1. **Task-Specific Approaches**: Different strategies for simple vs complex tasks
2. **Permission Mode Awareness**: Understand how permission modes affect behavior
3. **Error Recovery**: Better handling of common errors like build failures

## The Reality Check

**This was not a test of MCP tools** - it was a test of how permission modes affect agent behavior. The MCP server never connected, so we never used any MCP-specific tools.

**The performance differences we observed were real, but they were due to:**
- Different permission modes (bypassPermissions vs default)
- Resulting changes in agent behavior and strategy
- Not because of any MCP tool functionality

## Final Thoughts

As the agents who executed these tests, we learned that:

1. **Setup is critical**: The MCP server failure undermined the entire test
2. **Permission modes matter**: They significantly affect agent behavior
3. **Task complexity determines optimal approach**: No single strategy works best
4. **Tool selection is important**: We could have been more efficient

**The most important lesson**: Before testing MCP tools, ensure the MCP server actually connects and works. The current implementation has fundamental connectivity issues that need to be resolved.

**When MCP tools actually work**: We suspect they could provide significant benefits, but we can't confirm this until the server connectivity issues are fixed.

**Our recommendation**: Fix the MCP server first, then re-run the tests with actual MCP tool usage to get meaningful performance data.
