### Cleanup Mechanism
```javascript
async cleanup() {
  await fs.rm(this.testDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
  await fs.rm(this.logDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
  await fs.rm(path.join(process.cwd(), 'benchmark-results'), { recursive: true, force: true });
}
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Results Analysis

### Current Benchmark Limitations
The initial benchmark run revealed environment-specific limitations:
- **Claude CLI Execution**: Commands failed due to environment constraints
- **File System Operations**: ES module/CommonJS compatibility issues
- **Real Metrics Collection**: Limited to framework execution metrics

### Expected Performance Improvements

Based on v2.12.0 enhancements, anticipated improvements include:

#### Duration Reduction (25-40%)
- **Forceful Tool Descriptions**: Eliminate test file creation overhead
- **WFGY Framework**: Structured approach reduces exploration time
- **Batch Execution**: Coordinated workflows minimize latency

#### Turn Reduction (50-70%)
- **MCP Tool Mandates**: Prevent unnecessary conversation turns
- **Structured Analysis**: Sequential thinking documents process efficiently
- **Pattern Matching**: AST tools provide precise code locations

#### Token Efficiency (30-50%)
- **Eliminated Test Files**: No test creation/execution tokens
- **Direct Tool Usage**: Targeted code analysis and modification
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple tools in single API calls

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Behavioral Improvements

### 1. Forceful Tool Descriptions
**Before**: Agents create test files to explore code
**After**: Agents compelled to use MCP tools directly
```
"STRUCTURAL CODE SEARCH - MANDATORY USE FOR PATTERN MATCHING. NEVER write custom pattern matching code - ALWAYS use this MCP tool."
```

### 2. WFGY Framework Implementation
- **What For**: Clear requirements definition before tool selection
- **Get**: Efficient data acquisition using appropriate MCP tools
- **Yield**: Maximum insight extraction from acquired data

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Actionable Guidance**: Error messages suggest next steps
- **Tool Recovery**: Automatic fallback to alternative tools
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain analysis state across errors

## ðŸ“‹ Task-Specific Analysis

### React Development Tasks
**Expected Improvement**: 35-45% turn reduction
- Component creation without test file iterations
- Direct AST pattern matching for React hooks
- Batch execution for setup + testing

### Node.js Backend Tasks
**Expected Improvement**: 30-40% duration reduction
- Express middleware creation without prototype testing
- Direct file system operations via executebash
- Integrated API testing with MCP tools

### Algorithm Implementation
**Expected Improvement**: 40-50% efficiency gain
- Direct code analysis without test scaffolding
- AST-based optimization suggestions
- Performance benchmarking integration

### API Development
**Expected Improvement**: 25-35% faster completion
- WebSocket testing without external tools
- Real-time monitoring with batch execution
- Error handling through MCP validation

## ðŸ”§ Identified Improvements for v2.13.0

### 1. Enhanced Tool Coordination
**Issue**: Current batch execution lacks intelligent tool sequencing
**Solution**: Implement dependency-aware tool ordering
```javascript
// Enhanced batch execution with dependency graph
const optimizedBatch = [
  { tool: 'searchcode', query: 'user authentication patterns' },
  { tool: 'astgrep_search', pattern: 'function.*auth.*middleware' },
  { tool: 'executebash', command: 'npm test auth.middleware.test.js' }
];
```

### 2. Improved Error Recovery
**Issue**: Tool failures often require manual intervention
**Solution**: Automatic retry with alternative approaches
```javascript
// Intelligent error recovery
if (toolFailure) {
  const alternatives = getAlternativeTools(failedTool);
  return alternatives[0]; // Automatically retry with best alternative
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Metrics Collection
**Issue**: Limited insight into actual conversation patterns
**Solution**: Deeper integration with Claude's conversation tracking

### 4. Environment-Aware Prompts
**Issue**: Generic prompts may not suit all project types
**Solution**: Context-aware prompt enhancement based on project structure

## ðŸš€ Framework Capabilities

### 1. Scalable Testing
- Support for additional programming languages
