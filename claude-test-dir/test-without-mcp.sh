Tools Used: Standard Claude Code capabilities only

Key Observations:
- Complex tasks require manual code analysis and implementation
- No specialized tools for code search, AST analysis, or performance profiling
- Implementation details must be manually specified
- Testing and validation require manual setup
- No automated code transformation or refactoring capabilities

Next Steps: Compare with MCP REPL tools performance
