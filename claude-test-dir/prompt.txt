I need you to perform a comprehensive security audit and performance analysis of this Node.js application using MCP REPL tools.

Tasks:
1. **Security Analysis**: Use searchcode and AST tools to find security vulnerabilities including authentication issues, input validation problems, and potential injection attacks
2. **Performance Optimization**: Use MCP tools to identify performance bottlenecks, inefficient database queries, and memory leaks
3. **Code Quality Assessment**: Use AST analysis tools to identify code quality issues, architectural problems, and best practices violations
4. **Error Handling Review**: Use code search to analyze error handling patterns and suggest improvements
5. **Scalability Assessment**: Use project analysis tools to evaluate the application's scalability and suggest improvements

The application is in the current directory. Please use MCP REPL tools for:
- Semantic code search with searchcode
- AST pattern matching with astgrep_search
- Code analysis with astgrep_analyze
- Performance profiling and benchmarking
- Project-wide analysis and validation

Provide:
- Specific vulnerabilities found with file paths and line numbers
- Performance bottlenecks with optimization recommendations
- Code quality issues with before/after examples
- Security remediation strategies
- Architectural improvement suggestions

Focus on actionable recommendations and use MCP tools to validate your findings.
