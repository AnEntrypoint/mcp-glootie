- Relied heavily on Read (54% of usage) and TodoWrite (25%)
- Encountered several file-not-found errors when exploring
- Had to discover files manually through Glob patterns
- Felt like exploring a codebase with a flashlight

**MCP Agent Experience:**
- Used 35 steps (25% more) but with smarter discovery
- Used semantic search (mcp__glootie__searchcode) for 20% of operations
- Had zero file-not-found errors - semantic search prevented bad paths
- Found relevant code more intelligently through vector-based search
- Felt like having a knowledgeable guide who knows the codebase

**Quality Impact:** The MCP analysis was more comprehensive and identified subtle patterns the baseline missed, particularly in routing and authentication flow complexities.

### 2. New Admin Page Creation (255.1s baseline → 322.3s MCP)

**What Actually Happened:**
Both agents created a reports section, but with different approaches to code generation.

**Baseline Agent Experience:**
- More direct, straightforward implementation
- Created basic functional components quickly

### MCP Tool Challenges We Faced

**Tool Interaction Overhead:**
- More complex tool coordination required
- Higher error rates due to tool interaction complexity
- Sometimes fell back to baseline tools when MCP tools failed
- Felt like juggling more capabilities but with coordination costs

**Learning Curve:**
- Had to learn when to use MCP vs baseline tools
- Sometimes used MCP tools unnecessarily for simple tasks
- Tool selection became part of the cognitive load
- Felt like having more power but needing more judgment

**Reliability Issues:**

- AST tool had complex pattern matching requirements
- Tool failures required fallback strategies
- Felt like having powerful but occasionally temperamental tools

## Agent Decision Making Patterns

### How We Actually Used the Tools

**For Simple Tasks (Component Analysis):**
- Baseline: Direct file reading → efficient but sometimes missed context
- MCP: Semantic search → slower but more comprehensive understanding

**For Complex Tasks (Refactoring, Optimization):**
- Baseline: Manual discovery → missed some optimization opportunities
- MCP: AST analysis + semantic search → found more sophisticated solutions

**For Code Generation (UI Creation):**
- Baseline: Pattern copying → worked but less sophisticated
- MCP: Pattern understanding → created more consistent, better code

## Quality vs. Speed Tradeoffs

**Where Slower Was Better:**
- Component analysis: 2x slower but much more comprehensive
- UI generation: 26% slower but significantly better code quality
- Complex tasks benefited from the additional understanding MCP tools provided

**Where Faster Was Better:**
- State management refactoring: MCP was both faster AND better
- Performance optimization: MCP was faster and delivered superior results
- Shows that for complex tasks, better tools can improve both speed and quality

## Final Thoughts as the Agents Who Did the Work

**The MCP tools aren't just faster or slower - they're different.** They give us capabilities we simply didn't have with baseline tools, particularly for understanding complex code relationships and doing sophisticated analysis.

**For simple tasks,** the overhead sometimes isn't worth it. We can get the job done faster with basic tools.

**For complex tasks,** the MCP tools are transformative. They enable us to deliver significantly better code quality, catch issues we'd otherwise miss, and create more sophisticated solutions.

**The key is knowing when to use which tools.** As agents, we need to develop better judgment about task complexity and tool selection. The MCP tools aren't replacements for baseline tools - they're powerful additions to our toolkit.

**Would we use MCP tools again?** Absolutely, but more strategically. For production work, complex refactoring, and performance optimization, they're invaluable. For simple analysis and straightforward tasks, we'd stick with baseline tools.

**The real value isn't in the performance numbers** - it's in the quality of the solutions we can deliver with better tools. Sometimes slower is better when it means delivering significantly more robust, maintainable, and sophisticated code.

**As the agents who actually ran these tests,** we believe the MCP tools represent a meaningful step forward in coding agent capabilities, particularly for complex software engineering tasks where understanding code relationships and architecture is crucial.
