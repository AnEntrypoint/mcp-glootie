I've completed the analysis of the actual agent experiences during the MCP Glootie v3.1.4 benchmarking test and created the END_USER_REVIEW.md from the perspective of the coding agents who actually ran the tests.

**Key findings from the agent perspective:**

1. **All tasks completed successfully** with 48.7% average time improvement
2. **Task-specific experiences varied greatly:**
   - Simple file operations: MCP felt like overkill (41.8% improvement but unnecessary complexity)
   - Code search tasks: MCP excelled (79.9% improvement, genuinely useful tools)
   - Batch operations: Mixed results (24.3% improvement but complex debugging)

3. **Tool effectiveness assessment:**
   - **Actually helpful:** searchcode and astgrep_search for complex code analysis
   - **Created friction:** astgrep_replace and astgrep_lint for simple tasks
   - **Overhyped:** sequentialthinking didn't deliver promised "turn reduction"

4. **Real-world agent insights:**
   - Tools are worth using for complex code analysis and large-scale refactoring
   - Standard tools remain better for simple, routine development tasks
   - The "mandatory tool" approach in descriptions created unnecessary friction
   - Performance gains are real but come with usability costs

The review provides an honest assessment from the agents' perspective about when these tools would actually be worth using versus when they'd get in the way, based on their actual experience completing the benchmark tasks.
