## 2. Error Rates and Types

### Error Analysis
- **Baseline Total Errors**: 1 (File does not exist error in component analysis)
- **MCP Total Errors**: 2 (Both MCP connection failures)
- **Error Recovery**: 100% - all errors successfully recovered with fallback strategies

### Specific Error Patterns

#### 1. File Not Found Error (Baseline)
**Location**: Component Analysis Baseline
**Error**: `<tool_use_error>File does not exist.</tool_use_error>`
**Context**: Agent attempted to read non-existent file `src/routes/_authenticated/__root.tsx`
**Recovery**: Successfully continued with alternative file discovery using Glob patterns
**Impact**: Minimal - delayed task progression by ~2 steps

#### 2. MCP Connection Failures (MCP)
**Location**: Optimization MCP Task
**Errors**:
- `"MCP error -32000: Connection closed"`
- `"Not connected"`
**Context**: AST tool operations failed during complex code analysis
**Recovery**: Agent immediately fell back to traditional Grep tools with comment: "Let me use traditional search tools to find the components"
**Impact**: Moderate - required tool switching but maintained task progression

---

## 3. Agent Decision-Making Patterns

### Successful MCP Integration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Complementary Tool Usage
**Example**: Component Analysis MCP
```javascript
// Agent used MCP searchcode alongside traditional tools
{
  "name": "mcp__glootie__searchcode",
  "input": {
    "query": "project structure package.json vite config",
    "workingDirectory": "...",
    "topK": 10
  }
}
// Followed by:
{
  "name": "Bash",
  "input": {
    "command": "find . -type f -name \"*.json\" -o -name \"*.ts\" -o -name \"*.tsx\" | head -20",
    "description": "Get overview of project files and structure"
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 2: Strategic Tool Selection
**Example**: UI Generation MCP
```javascript
// Agent chose MCP for high-level pattern discovery
{
  "name": "mcp__glootie__searchcode",
  "input": {
    "query": "TanStack Router file-based routing patterns src/routes/_authenticated",
    "workingDirectory": "...",
    "topK": 10
  }
}
// Used traditional tools for specific file operations
{
  "name": "Glob",
  "input": {
    "pattern": "src/routes/_authenticated/**/*.tsx"
  }
}
```

### Fallback Decision Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Graceful Degradation
**Example**: Optimization MCP
```javascript
// MCP failure triggered immediate fallback
"Let me use traditional search tools to find the components"
// Followed by traditional Grep usage
{
  "name": "Grep",
  "input": {
    "output_mode": "files_with_matches",
    "pattern": "@tanstack/react-table"
  }
}
```

## 4. Friction Points and Challenges

### Major Friction Points

#### 1. MCP Connection Instability
**Issue**: AST tool operations caused connection drops during complex analysis
**Frequency**: 2 occurrences in optimization task
**Impact**: Required context switching and tool re-learning
**Root Cause**: Potentially long-running AST operations exceeding timeout limits

#### 2. Inconsistent Search Results
**Issue**: MCP searchcode frequently returned empty results `[]` even for existing patterns
**Example**: Search for "@tanstack/react-table components" returned no results despite 22 matching files found by Grep
**Impact**: Reduced trust in MCP tools, increased verification overhead

#### 3. Tool Coordination Overhead
**Issue**: Agents had to manually coordinate between MCP and traditional tools
**Example**: Running both MCP searchcode and Bash/Glob for similar discoveries
**Impact**: Increased token usage and decision complexity

### Minor Friction Points

#### 1. File Path Assumptions
**Issue**: Agents made assumptions about file structure that didn't match reality
**Example**: Assuming `__root.tsx` files in specific locations
**Impact**: Minor delays, easy recovery

#### 2. Query Formulation Challenges
**Issue**: MCP search queries required specific formulation for effective results
**Example**: Broad queries like "components organization" worked better than technical queries
**Impact**: Learning curve for effective MCP usage

**Example**:
- Working: "components organization layout sidebar navigation"
- Failed: "@tanstack/react-table components and recharts visualizations"
**Impact**: Made MCP usage less predictable
**Root Cause**: Query parsing or semantic matching limitations
